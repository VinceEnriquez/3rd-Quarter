	<p>	 Nam Joo-Hyuk plays Baek Yi-Jin, a once wealthy son who lost everything, in the touching South Korean drama "Twenty Five Twenty One," whereas Kim Tae-Ri plays Na Hee-Do, a young aspirant fencer.</p>
	<p>The late 1990s are depicted in flashbacks when Kim Min-Chae (Myung-Bin Choi), Na Hee-Do's daughter,quits ballet and goes to her grandmother's house. She later discovers her mother's diary.</p>
	<p>After her school's fencing team was disbanded as a byproduct of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Na, a once-prodigious fencer, now battles to convince herself and others that she can realize her full potential. </p>
	<p>Na sets out on a journey to convince her mother and coach, who have been pressuring her to discontinue fencing. Her eccentric persona, however, is what hinders the urge to continue and fight.</p>
